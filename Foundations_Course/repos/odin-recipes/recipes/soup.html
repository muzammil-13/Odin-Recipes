    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There’s nothing like a hot bowl of soup to help keep things cozy in wintertime. This vegetable soup, packed with cabbage, carrots, and potatoes, does the trick (and then some). It only requires a few ingredients and comes together in under an hour.  And since it's so hearty, you don’t even have to serve it with anything if you don't want to.
    </p>
